# static-cutouts-express

## motivation

Sometimes it is not necessary to use the backend (other JS server runtimes such as non-Node) to cut some pages and use a modern front-end framework, but not SSR content. We can use back-end frameworks such as template + express to solve front-end engineering problems such as HTML without manual repetitive code writing.
